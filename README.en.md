**Front-End Developer in training**

I'm a professional with a background in Multimedia and currently studying in the CET – Technical Specialist in Programming course at IEFP, where I’m deepening my knowledge in object-oriented programming, data structures, databases, and modern web development.

My path brings together **art, logic, and technology** — from design and digital communication to building functional and well-structured web projects.

I’m currently developing skills in **React, Next.js, Node.js, REST APIs, and MySQL**, learning to create organized and efficient applications focused on delivering a good experience for users.  

**Languages & Tools:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, PHP, SQL, C, C++, Java, UML, XML  
**Experience with:** VS Code, Visual Studio, NetBeans, XAMPP, MySQL Workbench, SQLite, PlantUML, Expo, Postman, FileZilla, and Figma  

I enjoy learning continuously and improving in the creation of interfaces that communicate with simplicity, functionality, and truth.  

✨ Here I share a bit of my digital universe — made of code, design, and real dedication.
