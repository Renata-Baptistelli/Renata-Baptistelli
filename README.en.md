# Hello! I'm Renata Baptistelli ✨

I'm a Multimedia Technician and currently enrolled in the CET — Technical Specialist in Programming at IEFP, where I'm deepening my knowledge in object-oriented programming, modeling, data structures, databases, and modern web development.

My journey blends art, strategy, and technology. I’ve worked with design, social media, and authentic digital content creation for entrepreneurs and brands.

I also have experience as a web designer on large-scale projects in e-commerce and international tourism — a background that strengthened my perspective on functional design, usability, and strategic visual communication.

I believe that combining design and programming is the key to creating solutions that not only work well but also bring clarity, comfort, and a smooth experience for users.

**Languages & Tools:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, React, C, C++, Java, UML, XML.  
**Experience with:** VS Code, Visual Studio, NetBeans, Dev C++, XAMPP, MySQL Workbench, SQLite (MariaDB), PlantUML, XPath Generator, Expo, Postman, FileZilla, and Figma.

I stay focused on learning, evolving, and developing interfaces that communicate with beauty and functionality.

✨ Here I share a bit of my digital universe — made of code, color, and real dedication.
